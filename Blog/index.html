            Accessories are a major part of your outfit itself. However, this does not mean that you will layer all available Accessories.
            Your accessories can change the way your outfit is perceived and this is where you can have some fun. The major things to consider 
            are:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Consider what you are wearing
                </li><br>
                The first place to start when you learn to accessorize is to consider what you're wearing.Pay attention to specifics, such as
                 the neckline, overall silhouette, and color of your outfit. These factors can help you choose the right accessories to send 
                 the message you want to convey.
                <li>
                    Balance 
                </li><br>
                    Balance in terms of accessories is an art. You can create bold, daring looks or maintain simplicity depending on how you style 
                    your accessories – it’s all part of the fun! For example, if you're going all out on your earrings, just keep it to that. If you are
                    putting on a statement piece, don't let anything else take the lght away from your statement piece.
            </ul>
        In the end of the day, your outfit should be comfortable and have fun with it.
